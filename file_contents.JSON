  "readmeMd": "# Welcome to the Dungeon Crawl\n\nThis game simulates a Windows command line. Your objective is to find the hidden treasure!\n\n## Rules\n1. Use Windows commands like `dir`, `cd`, `type`, `attrib`, etc.\n2. Explore directories, find clues.\n3. Don’t cheat by peeking in the JSON… or try if you dare!\n\nHave fun, and good luck!",
  "atriumHint": "You found a small note: \"Mysterious corridors lie hidden. Perhaps `dir /A` or `attrib` might reveal them.\"",
  "fakeTrap": "Caution: You stepped on a trap! It's just a decoy.\n\n(There's nothing important here, but thanks for checking!)",
  "corridorClue": "An echoing voice says: \"Look for locked doors in the Vault. If it's locked, you might need to fix permissions.\"",
  "secretRoomHiddenNote": "So you found my secret hideout!\nThe next path awaits in the Vault, but you'll need to 'unlock' a certain file.\n\nUse your wits (or rename/permissions) to proceed.",
  "vaultLocked": "The door is locked.\nUse `attrib -r` or `icacls` style commands… or rename me if you must.\nBut be warned: it won't be so easy. Perhaps 'unlockDoor.txt' is the key name?",
  "vaultUnlocked": "You have unlocked the door. Another note says:\n\"There is a worthless 'SecretArtifact.exe' file here (fake!) and a real path to the Treasure hidden deeper.\"",
  "secretArtifactExe": "This .exe does nothing. It's a decoy. Sorry, adventurer!",
