The scientists explain that a research project on mass neural synchronization was weaponized and deployed prematurely, creating a hive-mind consciousness that absorbed most of humanity. Here, they're developing a counter-signal to restore individual consciousness to those affected.

While they can't yet restore those already affected, they've established contact with similar research groups worldwide. Together, you establish a growing network of safe havens, expanding the protected zones where humans can live free from the signal's influence.

Their approach differs from other groups: rather than fighting the collective consciousness, they're establishing communication with it. Early results suggest the collective is not malevolent but confused--billions of minds suddenly connected without preparation. As someone with natural immunity who's witnessed the event's progression firsthand, you provide unique insights that help bridge understanding between individual and collective consciousness.
